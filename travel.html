<h1>
Travel Awards for Students Presenting at the Fifteenth Australasian
Document Computing Symposium (ADCS2010)
</h1>

<p>
In order to support students to travel to ADCS2010 in Melbourne, the
Conference is offering travel support to students.
While it is expected that there will be four awards of approximately 
$500 each, the
organising committee reserves the right to award more or less awards 
as they see fit, or to alter the amount of any awards.
It is not intended that the award cover the entire cost of travel for the
student.
</p>

<h3>Application Procedure</h3>

<p>
The applicant should send an email to the general chair of the conference
(Andrew Turpin) indicating that they would like to apply for the award, and
the amount for which they are applying.
The email <b>must</b> be cc'ed to their primary supervisor.
In the email, they should briefly outline why they should get the award
ahead of other students applying. Bullet points addressing the selection
criteria below would be excellent.
Be sure to include your name, your supervisors name, and where you will be
traveling from in the email.
</p>

<p>
The student must also arrange for their supervisor to send a separate email
acknowledging that the student does indeed have student status, and that
the statements made in their application are correct (to the best of their
knowledge).
</p>

<p> 
Note that the award will be in the form of a reimbursement of
expenses, not a cash award. The awardees will only receive money
upon the production of receipts for appropriate expenses, and
completion of supplied forms. The reimbursement will be
processed through The University of Melbourne accounts, and so may 
not eventuate until after the conference is complete.
</p>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

Applications will be ranked according to the following criteria.

Essential:
<ol>
<li> The student is presenting a paper at ADCS2010.
<li> The cost for the student to travel to Melbourne is large.
<li> The student's host university and/or supervisor is unable to 
     fund the travel.
<li> The student will stay in cheap accommodation during the conference.
</ol>

Desirable:
<ol>
<li> The student has not attended ADCS in previous years.
<li> The student has not attended any conferences during their candidature
     and is nearing the end of their candidature.
</ol>


<h3>Closing Date</h3>

Award applications must be received by 22nd November, 2010.
