<h3>Aim of the symposium</h3>

<p>ADCS 2010 is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
document management and information retrieval to meet and present
their work.  The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document
Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document
architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management,
retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual
documents.  The symposium emphasises both commercial and academic
issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.</p>

</ul>



<h3>Submissions</h3>

<p> Submissions should comply with
the <a href="paperguide.html">paper guidelines</a>.  All submissions
must be original work, not previously published elsewhere, and not
currently submitted to any other conference or journal.</p>

<p><b>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking
that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will
attend the symposium to present the work.</b> Note also that it is
insufficient for an author to register and pay for the symposium to
be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.</p>

<p><b>Papers should be submitted 
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adcs2010">online 
through EasyChair</a>.</b> </p>
<p>
Camera-ready versions of papers should be uploaded through EasyChair <b>as a proceedings author</b>.
</p>

<h4>Full papers</h4>

<p>Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
issues.  Submissions should be at most eight pages long (around 3000 words); 
over-length submissions risk immediate rejection.  Refer to
the <a href="paperguide.html">guidelines for papers</a> for details of
the required format.</p>

<h4>Posters, short papers and industry status reports</h4>

<p>To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for
work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short
papers, up to a maximum of four pages (around 1500 words).  
A typical proposal might
describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document
management.  Short papers follow the same format as for full papers.</p>

<p>Presentation of short papers will be via a poster session.
Accepted short papers will also be included in a separate section of
the symposium proceedings.</p>

<!--
<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Student Posters</font></font></h4>
We also encourage student to submit a one to two page summary of their
recent or proposed work to be presented as a speed talk (1 or 2 minutes)
and a poster. Students who take up this option will receive a discount on their registration fee.
-->

<!--
<h4>Demonstrations</h4>

<p>If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please
submit an abstract following the same format as for short papers.
Demonstrations should be self-contained, and only limited hardware
support will be available at the venue.</p>

-->

<h4>Proceedings</h4>

<p>
<!--Proceedings of the papers will be distributed to participants at
the symposium. -->
Electronic copies of the papers will be
made available after the symposium.
All submissions will be fully refereed by a blind refereeing process,
at their full published length, and will comply with DEST criteria for
fully-refereed conference papers (category F1).</p>
